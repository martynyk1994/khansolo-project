# khansolo-project
Python program that helps other people to learn a basic calculation process

Program will randomly generates simple additionproblems for the user,
reads in the answer from the user, and then checks to see if they got it right or wrong,
until the user appears to have mastered the material.



More specifically, program should be able to generate simple addition problems that involve adding two 2-digit integers (i.e., the numbers 10 through 99).  
The user should be asked for an answer to each problem.  
Program determine if the answer was correct or not, and give the user an appropriate message to let them know how they did.  
Program will keep giving the user problems until the user has gotten 3 problems correct in a row.

Good luck :)
